      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>I am a B.Sc. graduate in Industrial Engineering (GPA 3.8/4.0) from Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic), where my academic journey led me toward applying artificial intelligence and data science to real-world challenges, with a current focus on healthcare.</p>
      <p>My current research as a Research Assistant focuses on graph neural networks for medication recommendation and drug–drug interaction prediction using MIMIC-IV, with two manuscripts in preparation.</p>
      <p>Through both research and professional experience, I have developed expertise in machine learning, deep learning, and data science. Professionally, I designed and implemented relational databases to improve data accessibility, built interactive KPI dashboards for real-time monitoring, and developed clustering-based segmentation and churn prediction models to enhance retention strategies. I also led business analytics projects in sales forecasting and benchmarking, and created demand forecasting models that strengthened inventory planning and supply chain efficiency.</p>
      <p>Certified in Applied Data Science by MIT Professional Education, with experience in Python (PyTorch, PyTorch Geometric, TensorFlow, scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy), SQL/databases, and BI tools. I am passionate about bridging AI, healthcare, and data science to build interpretable systems that enhance decision-making and create meaningful real-world impact.</p>
